# OpenBot: Robot Body

[简体中文](README_CN.md)

We have designed a body for a wheeled robot which relies on low-cost, readily available hobby hardware.

## 3D printed chassis

You will need to print the following parts in order to build your OpenBot.

1) body_bottom ([STL](cad/regular_body/body_bottom.stl), [STEP](cad/regular_body/body_bottom.step))
2) body_top ([STL](cad/regular_body/body_top.stl), [STEP](cad/regular_body/body_top.step))
3) phone_mount_bottom ([STL](cad/phone_mount/phone_mount_bottom.stl), [STEP](cad/phone_mount/phone_mount_bottom.step))
4) phone_mount_top ([STL](cad/phone_mount/phone_mount_top.stl), [STEP](cad/phone_mount/phone_mount_top.step))

For the above parts, your build plate needs to be at least 240mmx150mm.

Since a lot of common 3D printers have a smaller build volume, we have also made a [slim body](cad/slim_body/README.md) which fits on a 220mmx220mm build plate at 45 degrees.

For printing on 3D printers with even smaller build volumes, there is also a [glueable body](cad/glue_body/README.md) which fits on a 150mmx140mm build plate. Thanks to @sloretz.

On an Ultimaker S5, we achieved good results with the following settings:

- layer height: 0.2mm
- wall thickness: 1.5mm
- infill density: 20%
- infill pattern: grid
- print speed 80 mm/s
- no support

We were able to print the chassis with PLA, ABS and CPE. In our experience the print was not affected very much by the print settings. However, if you have the patience, printing slower and with smaller layer height will improve the print. Also adding a support structure can improve the print, but it will require additional work to remove afterwards.

## Assembly

There are two different options for assembly of the robot, DIY and PCB. The DIY approach relies on the popular L298N motor driver and is recommended for hobbyists with some electronics experience. It requires a fair amount of wiring, especially if all the sensors and LEDs are installed. However, all components are readily available in most contries and especially for single builds or just to try out the project, the DIY option is recommended. In order to reduce the wiring and make assembly easier, we have also developed a [custom PCB](pcb). This is recommended if you desire a cleaner build or want to build multiple OpenBots.

### Bill of materials

Our robot body relies on readily available hobby electronics. We provide links for Germany (EU) and the United States (US) with fast shipping. If you have the patience to wait a bit longer, you can also get the compoenents a lot cheaper from AliExpress (AE). You will need the following components.

### Build instructions

#### Option 1: DIY

![Wiring Diagram](../docs/images/wiring_diagram.jpg)

1. Solder wires to the motors.
2. Insert the positive and negative leads of the two left motors into OUT1 (+) and OUT2 (-) of the L298N board.
3. Insert the positive and negative leads of the two right motors into OUT4 (+) and OUT3 (-) of the L298N board.
4. Mount the L298N with four M3x5 screws and the motors with eight M3x25 screws and nuts.
5. (Optional) Install the ultrasonic sensor and orange LEDs.
6. Mount the bottom of the phone mount to the top plate using two M3x25 screws and nuts.
7. Insert the top of the phone mount and install the spring or rubber band.
8. Mount the speed sensors with one M3x5 screw each.
9. Install the battery case (e.g. velcro).
10. (Optional) Insert the on/off switch.
11. Connect the PWM inputs of the L298N to pins D5, D6, D9 and D10 of the Arduino.
12. Connect the speed sensors and ultrasonic sensor to 5V and GND.
13. Connect pin D0 of the speed sensors to pins D2 (left) and D3 (right) of the Arduino.
14. Connect pins Trigger and Echo of the ultrasonic sensor to pins D11 and D12 of the Arduino respectively.
15. Connect the USB cable to the Arduino and route it through the top cover.
16. (Optional) Connect the LEDs to pins D7 (left) and D8 (right) of the Arduino and GND. We recommend to add a 150 Ohm resistor in series to limit the current draw.
17. (Optional) Connect the voltage divider to pin A7 of the Arduino. It is used to measure the battery voltage.
18. Connect the battery cables to Vin of the L298N. If you installed the switch, put it in the current path.
19. Insert six M3 nuts into the bottom plate and mount the top cover with six M3x25 screws.
20. Install the wheels.

#### Option 2: Custom PCB

1. Solder wires with connectors to the motors.
2. Connect the left two motors to M3 and M4 and the right two motors to M1 and M2.
3. Mount the PCB with four M3x5 screws and the motors with eight M3x25 screws and nuts.
4. Follow steps 5-10 from the DIY option.
5. Connect the LEDs, speed sensors and ultrasonic sensor to the PCB.
6. Connect the USB cable to the Arduino and route it through the top cover.
7. Connect the battery to Vin of the PCB. If you installed the switch, put it in the current path.
8. Follow steps 19-20 from the DIY option.
